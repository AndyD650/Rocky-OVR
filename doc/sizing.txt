Prod on OSL:
Web: 8GB Mem, 4 CPUs
Util: 8GB Mem, 8 CPUs
PDF: 8GB Mem, 8CPUs
PassengerMaxPoolSize 60

1CPU, 2GB Mem (+head room) = 15 Passengers could double with more ram 1/4 = 30 passengers
m3.medium = 1CPU, 3.75GB -> Uses all ram but 50% CPU...
r3.large = 2CPU, 16GB # Try for 45 passengers
c4.large = 2CPU (8ECU), 3.75GB # 4 PDF workers or 3?

MySQL - 2 core is *plenty*
Maybe 16GB RAM for prod? 
* db.r3.large 2 / 15
db.m4.xlarge 4 / 16
20GB storage
