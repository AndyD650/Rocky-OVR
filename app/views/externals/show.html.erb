    <p>Hey, it looks like you can finish your voter registration entirely online, without having to print, sign, and mail an application form.</p>

    <p>That's because you have a valid Colorado driver's license, and you can either change the address of your existing Colorado voter
      registration, or register in Colorado for the first time if you're eligible. If you fit the bill, you can finish your registration
      at the Colorado State Secretary's website.</p>

    <p class="centered"><%= link_to "Finish Registration Online with Colorado", go_registrant_external_path(@registrant), :target => '_blank' %></p>

    <p>Otherwise, you can continue here to get your voter registration form to print, sign, and mail to the Colorado State Secretary's office.</p>

    <p class="centered"><%= link_to "Continue Registration with Rock The Vote", registrant_step_4_path(@registrant) %></p>

    <p>Either is cool - it's up to you.</p>
