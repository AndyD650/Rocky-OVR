  <h2>Survey Questions</h2>
  <p>
    The survey questions are your opportunity to ask the applicant two questions during the voter
    registration process, and to ask the applicant if he or she would like to volunteer with your
    organization. You are not required to ask any questions if you don't want to. You can 
    <%= link_to "Edit Questions", edit_partner_questions_path %>
    to define or modify your questions. The answers provided by the applicants can be seen
    when you 
    <%= link_to "download your voter registration data", registrations_partner_path(:format => 'csv') %>.
