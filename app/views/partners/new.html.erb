<h1>Register</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to the Partner Portal of the Rock the Vote online voter registration tool. If you've already
  registered as a partner, you can <%= link_to "log in", login_path %>
  to return to your dashboard. If you're a new partner, then you
  can sign up below, and start your own voter registration drive. Once you have created your profile, you
  will be able to use your Partner Dashboard to customize portions of the voter registration tool, get code
  to embed buttons onto your website, see statistics about the people you are registering to vote, and
  download the registration data of those who register to vote through your website.
