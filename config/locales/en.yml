      instructions:
        state_id_number: You must provide an ID number from your state-issued driver's license or identity card.
          If you don't have either, then you must provide the last 4 digits of your Social Security Number.
        download: You're not done. Click on the print form button to print out your voter registration form.
          Sign it and mail to the address located on the form.
        download_2: You won't be registered unless you print, sign and mail in your form!

        non_citizen: You must be a U.S. citizen to register to vote.
        attest: You must confirm you are eligible to vote
      tooltips:
        email_address: We need your email address to make sure you can download your registration form. 
          Later, we'll also give you a chance to sign-up to receive more information from us.
        home_zip_code: We need your zip code to make sure your state registers voters.
        date_of_birth: You must be 16 years old to register to vote.
        registrant_name: You must provide your first and last name, and a prefix such as Ms., Mr., Mrs., or Miss. In addition, 
          you may provide your middle name and suffix, such as Jr., Sr. Providing your complete name, including middle name and 
          suffix, will be extremely helpful in identifying you in subsequent voter registration request, such as change of 
          address, and in finding an exact match with other state records such your driver's license or state ID card.
        home_address: Where you reside, even if it isn't where you receive mail.
        mailing_address: Where you receive mail.
        race: This isn't per-state yet.
        party: This isn't per-state yet.  Please enter the name of the political party with which you wish to register.  If you
          do not wish to register with an party, enter "Decline to State" in the space provided.
          California law allows voters who "decline to state" an affiliation with a qualified political party or who affiliate
          with a nonqualified political party that files a notice with the Secretary of State allowing them to do so.  You can 
          call 1-800-345-VOTE or visit www.ss.ca.gov to learn which political parties are allowing nonaffiliated voters to 
          participate in their primary election.
        state_id_number: This isn't per-state yet. You must provide an existing ID number in order to register to vote, so that your state can accurately 
          identify your voter registration records. Federal law requires you to provide an ID number from a state-issued driver's 
          license or identity card, if you have one. If you don't, then you must provide the last four digits of your Social 
          Security Number -- and only the last 4 digits. You should use this ID number any time you re-register to vote, or 
          update your address or other part of your voter registration record. If you're registering for the first time, 
          your state may have additional requirements for proof of identity the first time you vote -- please review the state 
          specific instructions in the voter registration form that you will shortly be printing out.
        phone: Your phone number is not required, but will be helpful in contacting you in a timely manner about voter registration matters.
        previous_name: If you've changed your name since your last registration, enter your previous name.
        previous_address: If you've moved since your last registration, enter your previous address.
