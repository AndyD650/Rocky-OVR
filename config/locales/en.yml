      description:
        general: This section allows partners with some knowledge of CSS and HTML
          to fully customized their registration tool. You have the option to overwrite
          the default CSS and modify the autoresponder emails. Simply upload new resources
          through the portal, review changes, and submit for approval. <a href="http://wiki.rockthevote.com/index.php/Examples"
          target="_BLANK">Here are some great examples</a>.
        assets:
        - Upload your graphics (background images, special icons, etc that will be
          referenced in your CSS)
        - Upload your licensed fonts (or include google webfonts directly in your
          CSS file using @import)
        - Upload a 468px wide by 400px tall logo called pdf_logo.gif and it will appear
          in the generated pdf. (make sure to save as a gif)
        css:
        - ! 'Create a file called partner.css that overwrites the default styles with
          your own. Reference the fonts and images already uploaded. (ie: body {background-image:
          url(‘mybackground.jpg’); color: #cc0000;} This file will load after the
          default styles so anything you define should change. Go to <a href="http://wiki.rockthevote.com"
          target="_blank">wiki.rockthevote.com</a> for some examples.'
        email_templates:
        - The registration platform will automatically send emails to new registrants
          to ensure they complete the process.
        - Partners are able to modify the templates to match your tone and brand.
        - Remember to keep those important HTML tags such as (<%= @registrant.first_name
          %> and <%= @registrar_phone %>) intact so dynamic content such as state
          phone numbers and other information can be pulled in appropriately.
        - We recommend using a text editor, such as TextWrangler.
        approval: Once you’ve made all your edits, please click the “Preview” button
          to see your changes. When you’re happy with how the tool looks, hit the
          “Submit for Approval” button. The Rock the Vote team will review and approve
          as soon as possible. This process may take up to 48 hours.
      preview_warning:
        not_set: Custom assets are not uploaded, default assets will be used
        not_changed: Partner's assets are not changed, continue?
