          For presidential preference elections, the registrant needs to
          be registered under a recognized party. For all other primary elections, voters
          registered as independent, no party preference or members of a party without ballot
          recognition are allowed to vote in the partisan Primary Election of their choice
          of one of the recognized political parties. Voters who are registered with a recognized
          political party will receive their political party's early ballot. Only registered
          members of the Arizona Libertarian Party may vote in the Libertarian Party Primary Election.

          a notice with the Secretary of State allowing them to do so.  You can call 1-800-345-VOTE

        indiana:>

          affiliation prior to voting in a primary election.
        massachusetts:>

          parties (Democrat, Republican, Green-Rainbow)

        not_done_with_state_name:>
          You do not register by political party in %{state_name}. However, in order to vote in a primary, you must request one particular party's ballot.
        party_not_required:>

          You may, but do not have to, register with a party in advance
          if you want to take part in that party's primary election.  To participate in
          a primary election or caucus, you must be registered with a party.  You may change

          caucus location.
